Python class 1 Assignment :
Q1) What is JPython and CPython?
Ans) CPython : CPython is the reference implementation of the Python programming language. Written in C and Python, CPython is the default and most widely used implementation of thelanguage.
JPython : Jython is an implementation of the Python programming language designed to run on the Java platform. The implementation was formerly known as JPython until 1999.

Q2) Basic dufference between python2 and python3.
Ans)  	A list of differences between Python 2 and Python 3 are given below:

	1. Python 2 uses print as a statement and used as print "something" to print some string on the console. On the other hand,		   Python 3 uses print as a function and used as print("something") to print something on the console.
	2. Python 2 uses the function raw_input() to accept the user's input. It returns the string representing the value, which is 	   typed by the user. To convert it into the integer, we need to use the int() function in Python. On the other hand, Python 3 	   uses input() function which automatically interpreted the type of input entered by the user.            
	3. In Python 2, the implicit string type is ASCII, whereas, in Python 3, the implicit string type is Unicode.
	4. Python 3 doesn't contain the xrange() function of Python 2. The xrange() is the variant of range() function which returns a 	   xrange object that works similar to Java iterator. The range() returns a list for example the function range(0,3) contains            0, 1, 2.

Q3) Difference between ASCII and unicode.
Ans) 	A list of differences between ASCII and Unicode are given below:

	1.ASCII uses an 8-bit encoding while Unicode uses a variable bit encoding.
	2.Unicode is standardized while ASCII isnâ€™t.
	3.Unicode represents most written languages in the world while ASCII does not.
	4.ASCII has its equivalent within Unicode.
